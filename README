 Description: This is the source repository of the MIR task-based runtime system. The name MIR is inspired by Mir publishers whose books I enjoyed during my childhood. I learned later on in life that "mir" means peace in Russian. To get started with using MIR, please see docs/USAGE.pdf.
 Alternative names: mir, Mir
