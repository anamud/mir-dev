Build with tilecc.
Test on TILEPro64.
Architecture specific SConstruct.
Simultaneous debug and release build in SConstruct. 
- Added debug and opt builds for mir
- Added debug, opt and verbose builds for benchmarks
Give git access to others.
- Have decided to use ssh public id to give access to interested users
- Have now setup gitolite. Intrested users will have to send ssh public key for access.
Setup git permissions 
- How? Dev and public repos?
- Gitolite to the rescue!
Find a good license. 
- How about GPL? Check with BSC about Mercurium and BOTS.
- Apache License 2.0 looks good.
Get started with clang support.
Strengthen Mercurium support.
Work on UTS.
- Scaling is poor.
- Why am I even bothering with this? Benchmark stresses fine grained execution. 
Work on benchmarks with data dependences.
- Added benchmarks with data footprint
Get a gimp to parallelize BOTS FFT and Strassen. 
- Done. Gimp = Me.
Add a clean user interface to the library 
- How? Machine generate the interface?
Find and add a good deque implementation. 
- Cannot find a lock-free or a single lock deque!
- Ask Shavit and Maged.
- PJ found one. Integrate it!
Add runtime dependence resolution support.
Add a help document.
- URGENT!
Add the NUMA/NUCA scheduler. 
- Done. Need to test it on the TILEPro64.
Add a benchmark testing script
- Done. In scripts/test.sh
Add dependence graph generation support
- Done. 
Add libgomp OpenMP wrapper
